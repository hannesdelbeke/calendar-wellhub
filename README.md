An exercise to write a python script to edit calendar events, using OAuth 2.0.

By default Wellhub events in google calendar start with `Wellhub - ...`  
This is bad UX on mobile, since it often only shows that in the title.  
This script can run on startup with task scheduler, to make the titles more readable.
